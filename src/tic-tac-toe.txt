1)I created my react app using:
npx create-react-app my-react-app
this made my file have all the necessary components to start working on my tictactoe
2) I created a function that made a button, i exported it and made it default so other files could use it
3) in index.js i imported the necessary components from other files such as react and index.css and reactDOM to help interact
4) in styles.css i defined the style of the button and some other components of my website
5)I built the board using a Square function and passed in the value of the Square so it could number the squares 1-9
6)put a function inside a function that logs a click 
7) we imported usestate to import the state that there is a square that was clicked
8) we created an array of states that has each state corresponding to a square in the board. we did this in the board function
9)in order to implement taking turns, we will flip a boolean called xIsNext, we flip it each time and we place it in the handleclick file
10)if it is already clicked then we will return the function early
11)in order to declare a winner we basically check the lines to see if theres 3 xs or 3os in a line.
12) if there is we can end the game early
13) we create a status to declare the winner, or also if x or o is next. We do this by using status: and if else statements.
